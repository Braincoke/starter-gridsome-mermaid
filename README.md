# Gridsome mermaid starter blog

A starter blog showing you how to use mermaidjs with Gridsome.

## Usage

Install the dependencies automatically with `npm install`.

Then use `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Dependencies

This starter code was created with an existing starter blog:

~~~bash
gridsome create my-blog https://github.com/lauragift21/gridsome-minimal-blog
~~~

The plugin `gridsome-plugin-remark-mermaid` was then installed and configured.

The `mermaid` themes have been installed in `src/scss/mermaid` and need `sass-loader and node-sass` to work:

~~~bash
npm install -D sass-loader node-sass
~~~
